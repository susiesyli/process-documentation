        <h1>Design Process of "MoMA 100"</h1>

        <p>Hi :) you're seeing the unfinished unpublished draft rn</p>

        <div class="process-image">

        <h2>The idea</h2>
        <p>Through various workshops and assignments in this class, I knew I was interested in 
            visualizing topics related to one or a combination of: architecture, fine arts, 
            contemporary art, curating, exhibitions, construction of posthumous identity
             in monographics, and network analysis in curating history.</p>
        <p>I spent ~a week researching and exploring these fields, during which 
            I created ~8 concept and mind maps to visualize their interconnections 
            and identify existing gaps in data visualization for these domains. 
            Below are two examples:</p>

        <div class="image-grid">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="img/research.png" alt="Process image 1">
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="img/research-arch.png" alt="Process image 2">
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="img/research-arch.png" alt="Process image 3">
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="img/research.png" alt="Process image 4">
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>In parallel to topical research, I looked for publicly available datasets, 
            and quickly decided to steer away from highly theoretical/qualitative topics 
            (e.g. postmodern curatorial theory) because their related datasets either 
            1) require substantial feature engineering to be suitable for narrative storytelling or 
            2) large-scale methods for unstructured data gathering (eg. unstructured web scraping).</p>

        <p>When I found <a href="https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection">MoMA's data collection</a>
            - comprising 3 extensive databases focused on artists, 
            artworks, and exhibitions - I felt this provided a perfect balance between structure 
            (well-organized tabular data, ideal for querying and analysis) and flexibility 
            (providing ample opportunities to craft compelling narratives).</p>
        
        <p>An initial reaction was to explore exhibitions, but this was dropped for 2 drawbacks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> The data is only available up till 1989.
            <li> The dataset consist largely of highly low-level technical details - on top of that, fragmented with large gaps in timeline - which did not provide a strong basis for data-driven narrative storytelling.
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            After speaking with Prof. Tuzcu about different ideas and representations/
            ways of communication, and with curator and critic Steven Madoff in November 
            about arguments in contemporary curating, I knew I wanted to specifically 
            explore and examine the discrepancy between the mission statement an art 
            institution claims to present vs. the actual message put forward through 
            their selection and presentation of works, artists, collections, narratives, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            For MoMA, this specifies down to to:
